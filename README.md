# Drop Offs Lose Bots
These generate more wins for users, they do not move in matches, but they go to game spots to join matches.

### Ratelimits
Technically, if you use the same bot two times, the wins stop coming, so you have to rotate from different bots.
### Termination
We **arent talking about roblox**, we are talking about drop offs. If you are found out to own this system, you might be banned from drop offs.
